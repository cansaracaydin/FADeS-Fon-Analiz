# Faz 2.5: Refined approach (less is more)
# Problem: Too many features (28) caused overfitting with limited data
# Solution: Keep best indicators only, focus on quality over quantity

## Changes:
1. Reduce lags back to 7 (not 10)
2. Keep only most predictive indicators:
   - Return lags (7)
   - RSI (proven signal)
   - MACD + Histogram (momentum)
   - Volatility_7d (recent volatility)
   - SMA_20 (trend)
   
3. Keep XGBoost but with regularization:
   - Add reg_alpha (L1)
   - Add reg_lambda (L2)
   - Lower max_depth to prevent overfitting

## Expected Result:
- R² should be positive (0.1 - 0.3)
- Cross-validation scores consistent
- No overfitting
